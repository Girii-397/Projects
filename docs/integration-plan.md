# Integration Plan for AI Features and Data Pipelines

## AI Integration
- **Frameworks**: DJL for Java-based inference, TensorFlow for custom models, Ollama for local LLMs.
- **Model Deployment**: Use MLOps with MLflow for versioning, monitoring accuracy, and retraining.
- **Federated Learning**: Implement for privacy-preserving model improvement across hospitals.
- **Ethical AI**: Integrate bias detection tools, explainability libraries (e.g., SHAP), and human oversight workflows.
- **New Modules**: AI models for emergency triage (priority scoring), mental health chatbot (sentiment analysis), pharmacy (drug interaction checks).

## Data Pipelines
- **Ingestion**: Kafka for real-time data from IoT/wearables; batch processing with Apache Spark for historical data.
- **Preprocessing**: Normalization, encryption, anomaly detection using Python scripts integrated via REST.
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL for structured data, Redis for caching, blockchain for EHR immutability.
- **APIs**: FHIR/HL7 adapters for interoperability; OAuth2 for secure third-party access.

## Steps for Integration
1. Set up AI model registry in MLflow.
2. Train and deploy models for triage, chatbot, drug interactions.
3. Deploy models via Kubernetes with auto-scaling.
4. Implement data pipelines with Apache Airflow for scheduling.
5. Test integrations with mock data; monitor with Prometheus/Grafana.
6. Continuous learning: Feedback loops to update models based on outcomes.

## Monitoring and Scaling
- Use Istio for service mesh to manage traffic.
- Alerts for model drift, data breaches.
- Scalability: Horizontal pod scaling based on load.
