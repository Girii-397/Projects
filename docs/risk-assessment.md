# Risk Assessment and Mitigation Plan

## Risks
- **AI Biases**: Models may perpetuate inequalities, especially in triage or mental health predictions.
- **Data Breaches**: Sensitive health data exposure in emergency or pharmacy logs.
- **Regulatory Non-Compliance**: HIPAA/GDPR violations in mental health privacy.
- **Ethical Concerns**: Misuse of AI for decisions, e.g., incorrect triage or chatbot advice.
- **Module-Specific**: Triage prioritization errors, chatbot escalating crises improperly, pharmacy dispensing wrong medications.

## Mitigation
- **AI**: Regular bias audits, diverse training data, explainable AI; specific testing for triage and chatbot accuracy.
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption, regular penetration testing, incident response plans; extra safeguards for mental health data.
- **Compliance**: Automated audits, legal reviews, staff training; ensure pharmacy logs meet regulations.
- **Ethics**: Human oversight for critical AI outputs, ethical guidelines; crisis protocols for chatbot.

## Contingency Plans
- Data breach: Immediate isolation, notification within 72 hours.
- AI failure: Fallback to manual processes.
- Scalability issues: Load testing and capacity planning.
