# Hospital Management & Healthcare AI System Architecture
<!-- cspell:ignore CCPA -->

## Overview
This document outlines the overall system architecture for the comprehensive Hospital Management & Healthcare AI System. The system integrates all specified functionalities into a secure, scalable platform prioritizing patient privacy, regulatory compliance (HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA), interoperability (FHIR, HL7, DICOM), and ethical AI use. It supports multi-language interfaces, real-time analytics, predictive modeling, accessibility (WCAG), and IoT/wearable integrations.

The architecture follows a microservices design deployed on Kubernetes, with modular services for each major functionality. Core technologies: Java (Spring Boot), PostgreSQL, React, AI/ML via DJL/TensorFlow/Ollama.

## Core Modules (Prioritized)
1. **Hospital Management & Administration**: Handles operations, scheduling, resource allocation, billing, etc.
2. **Patient-Centric Systems**: Manages EHR, monitoring, personalization, etc.
3. **Clinical Decision Support**: Provides AI-driven diagnosis, recommendations, etc.
4. **Emergency & Critical Care**: Manages trauma, triage, ICU monitoring, etc.
5. **Mental Health & Wellness**: Provides chatbot, stress monitoring, therapy support, etc.
6. **Pharmacy & Medication**: Handles inventory, prescriptions, adherence, etc.
7. **Public Health & Epidemiology**: Tracks outbreaks, surveillance, vaccination, etc.
8. **Diagnostics & Lab Systems**: Manages tests, imaging, AI analysis, etc.
9. **Insurance & Billing**: Handles claims, fraud detection, reimbursements, etc.
10. **Future & Emerging Healthcare**: AI Ethics, Metaverse integration, robotic surgery, genomics, etc.

## Module Boundaries
- **Hospital Mgmt Service**: Manages hospital operations, resources, billing. Boundaries: No direct patient clinical data; interfaces via APIs.
- **Patient-Centric Service**: Handles patient records, monitoring, personalization. Boundaries: Secure access controls; integrates with EHR blockchain.
- **Clinical Decision Support Service**: Provides AI recommendations. Boundaries: Explainable AI; no direct patient actions without human oversight.
- **Emergency & Critical Care Service**: Handles triage, ICU monitoring, organ matching. Boundaries: Real-time alerts; integrates with geolocation and IoT.
- **Mental Health & Wellness Service**: Provides AI chatbots, stress monitoring, therapy. Boundaries: Privacy-focused; sentiment analysis with ethical safeguards.
- **Pharmacy & Medication Service**: Manages inventory, prescriptions, adherence. Boundaries: Drug interaction checks; integrates with clinical data.
- **Public Health & Epidemiology Service**: Tracks outbreaks, surveillance, vaccination. Boundaries: Aggregated data only; no individual patient details without consent.
- **Diagnostics & Lab Systems Service**: Manages tests, imaging, AI analysis. Boundaries: DICOM/FHIR compliance; integrates with clinical pathways.
- **Insurance & Billing Service**: Handles claims, fraud detection, reimbursements. Boundaries: Multi-payer support; automated but human-verifiable.
- **AI Ethics Service**: Monitors AI biases, fairness, human oversight. Boundaries: Cross-cutting; integrates with all AI modules.
- **Metaverse Integration Service**: Handles virtual consultations, holographic imaging. Boundaries: VR/AR interfaces; secure data transmission.
- **Shared Services**: Security, Integration, AI/ML are cross-cutting.

## Security & Compliance
- End-to-end encryption (TLS 1.3, AES-256).
- Zero-trust architecture with MFA.
- Audit logs and compliance monitoring.
- Ethical AI: Bias audits, human-in-the-loop for critical decisions.

## Scalability
- Microservices with Docker/Kubernetes.
- Auto-scaling on AWS/Azure/GCP.
- Load balancing and serverless functions for AI inference.

## Data Flow
- Patient data flows from UI → API Gateway → Services → Database/Blockchain.
- AI models trained via federated learning; inferences via local LLMs.
- Real-time analytics via Kafka streams.

This architecture ensures modularity, security, and scalability for the full system expansion.
