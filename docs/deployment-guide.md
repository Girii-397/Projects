# Deployment Guide and CI/CD Pipelines

## CI/CD Pipelines
- **Tools**: GitHub Actions/Jenkins for automation.
- **Stages**: Build (Maven), Test (JUnit), Security Scan (SonarQube), Deploy (Kubernetes).
- **Pipeline Example**:
  ```yaml
  name: CI/CD
  on: push
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Build with Maven
          run: mvn clean install
        - name: Run Tests
          run: mvn test
        - name: Deploy to K8s
          run: kubectl apply -f k8s/
  ```

## Deployment Steps
1. Provision cloud resources (AWS EKS).
2. Configure PostgreSQL with encryption and new schemas.
3. Deploy microservices (including emergency, mental health, pharmacy, public health, diagnostics, insurance) via Helm charts.
4. Set up Istio for service mesh.
5. Enable monitoring with Prometheus.
6. Deploy AI models for new features.

## Security Checklists
- Encrypt secrets with Vault.
- Run vulnerability scans.
- Implement zero-trust policies.
- Regular audits for HIPAA compliance.

## Disaster Recovery
- Backups: Daily PostgreSQL dumps.
- Failover: Multi-region setup.
- Recovery Time Objective: <4 hours.

## User Training
- Manuals for staff on UI usage, including emergency triage, mental health chatbot, pharmacy management, public health surveillance, diagnostics workflows, insurance claims.
- Training sessions on AI features and new workflows.
